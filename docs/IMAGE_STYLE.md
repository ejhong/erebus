# Aletheia Image Style Guide

Current style version: **style-v2** (2026-08-22, hand-tinted color). Bump the
version when the canonical prompt changes, so regenerated art stays consistent
within a version and diffs between versions are deliberate.

## The two image registers — never confused

1. **Editorial artwork (AI-generated).** Covers, hero/brand art, textures,
   dividers. One signature style (below), always credited "AI-generated
   editorial artwork," always stylized enough that no one could mistake it
   for a photograph or for evidence.
2. **Plates (real imagery).** Photographs of sites, artifacts, murals,
   samples, micrographs, documents, data. Always real, always with
   provenance (photographer, date, source URL) and a verified license.
   Presented as numbered museum plates with a CSS duotone treatment —
   originals are never destructively edited, and hovering a plate restores
   the original color.

## The hard rule

**AI-generated images must never depict evidence.** No generated "photos" of
sites, artifacts, tool marks, chambers, lab results, micrographs, or
documents. Anything a reader could read as the record must be real imagery
with provenance. This is enforced in code: the image schema rejects
`source: generated` + `role: plate`, and the loader rejects generated images
embedded in the article's plate position. Do not weaken these checks.

Corollaries:

- Generated covers depict *ideas* (an allegorical wall, light through
  strata), not specific reconstructable scenes presented as documentation.
- If a generated image accidentally reads as a photograph, regenerate it
  with stronger engraving cues or discard it.
- Diagrams (ladder, timelines) stay hand-built SVG/CSS — never raster,
  never generated.

## House style: hand-tinted expedition lithograph (style-v2)

The signature is a 19th-century scientific expedition lithograph /
copperplate engraving — the visual language of Darwin-era journals: patient,
exact, beautiful because it is careful. It says "we looked closely" in a way
no stock photo can.

style-v2 keeps the engraving language of style-v1 but replaces the
monochrome palette lock with **hand-tinted full color**: think
chromolithographs and hand-colored plates from a vintage scientific atlas.
Full polychrome imagery, but only muted mineral pigments — ochres, slate
blues, sage greens, oxblood, faded vermilion — faded as if printed in 1870,
never saturated modern digital color. Each case cover gets its own dominant
tone suited to its subject (assigned below), so the case grid reads as one
atlas with plates from different expeditions rather than six copies of the
same plate. What stays locked: the engraving linework, the cream paper
(`#f6f1e8`), the quiet composition, and the muted-pigment ceiling on
saturation.

### Canonical prompt template (style-v2)

> Hand-tinted 19th-century scientific expedition lithograph, chromolithograph
> plate from a vintage natural-history atlas. **[SUBJECT — one or two
> sentences, allegorical or typological, never a specific evidence scene].**
> Fine copperplate cross-hatching and stipple engraving beneath soft,
> translucent hand-applied watercolor washes. Full color in subdued antique
> mineral pigments — **[CASE TONE — dominant pigments and where they sit]** —
> over warm-black ink linework on aged warm cream paper (#f6f1e8). Colors
> muted and slightly faded as if printed in 1870; never saturated modern
> digital color, no gradients, no glow. Darwin-era natural-history journal
> plate aesthetic, generous plain paper margins, quiet composition.
> Absolutely no text, no labels, no captions, no border frame lines.
> Unmistakably a hand-tinted engraving — stylized editorial artwork, not
> photorealistic, no photograph.

### Case tone assignments (style-v2)

Chosen to suit each subject and to harmonize as a set on the paper-toned
homepage grid: two warms, two cools, two greens, all at the same faded
mineral-pigment saturation. Defined in `scripts/generate-case-art.mjs`
(`CASE_TONES`); keep the two in sync.

| case | tone | pigments |
|---|---|---|
| `geopolymer` | Sandstone ochre | yellow ochre and raw sienna stone, umber shadows, pale grey-blue sky wash |
| `vasocomputation` | Anatomical madder | madder red and oxblood vessels, faded rose flesh tones, ivory bone, faint sage |
| `transients` | Prussian night | deep Prussian and slate blue night sky, silver-cream stars, small warm brass accent on the instrument |
| `orch-or` | Amethyst and gold | muted violet-grey and indigo forms, one antique-gold shaft of light |
| `ydih` | Sage and vermilion | sage and olive-green plain, buff sky, one faded vermilion comet streak |
| `mpi` | Verdigris | verdigris and muted teal, grey-green shadows, one pale sulfur-yellow butterfly accent |
| `ccc` | Slate and ember | deep charcoal-slate night sky, pale cream and faded antique-gold concentric rings, one small ember-red accent at the rings' center |

Rules of thumb:

- **Paper is still the site token** `#f6f1e8`; linework stays warm-black.
- One dominant tone per piece, one small counter-accent at most. If a
  candidate looks like modern digital color — saturated, glowing, gradient —
  reject it and regenerate.
- Ban text in the image (models garble it; captions belong in HTML).
- Covers ship at exactly 16:9 — the case-grid card renders `aspect-[16/9]`,
  so what you crop is what readers see. The model often draws its own plate
  frame despite the prompt; strip the frame line and paper margin, then cut
  the 16:9 band that keeps the composition's key emblems (comet, star,
  butterfly) — they tend to sit in the upper third.
- Post-process: crop as above, resize to ≤1600 px wide, JPEG quality ~75
  (`sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 75 -Z 1600 in.png --out out.jpg`).

### Superseded: style-v1 (monochrome)

The original house style was the same engraving language with a locked
monochrome palette. Site-level art (hero, textures) still uses it and does
not need regeneration; new covers should use style-v2.

### Canonical prompt template (style-v1, superseded for covers)

> 19th-century scientific expedition lithograph, copperplate engraving.
> **[SUBJECT — one or two sentences, allegorical or typological, never a
> specific evidence scene].** Fine cross-hatching and stipple shading,
> hand-engraved linework. Monochrome deep warm-black ink (#201b12) on aged
> warm cream paper (#f6f1e8), with one restrained oxidized-copper (#9a5b33)
> accent: **[WHERE THE SINGLE COPPER ACCENT GOES]**. Darwin-era
> natural-history journal plate aesthetic, generous plain paper margins,
> quiet composition. Absolutely no text, no labels, no captions, no border
> frame lines. Unmistakably an engraving — stylized editorial artwork, not
> photorealistic, no photograph.

Rules of thumb:

- **Palette is locked to the site tokens**: paper `#f6f1e8`, ink `#201b12`,
  copper `#9a5b33`. Exactly one copper accent per piece; everything else
  monochrome.
- Ban text in the image (models garble it; captions belong in HTML).
- Covers at 16:9; textures use large plain-paper fields so they crop well.
- Post-process: resize to ≤1600 px wide, JPEG quality ~75
  (`sips -s format jpeg -s formatOptions 75 -Z 1600 in.png --out out.jpg`).

### Existing style-v1 pieces

| id | role | subject |
|---|---|---|
| `IMG-SITE-HERO` | brand | parted strata, light, standing stone (unconcealment) |
| `IMG-SITE-DIVIDER-STRATA` | texture | sedimentary strata band with copper seam |
| `IMG-SITE-TAILPIECE` | texture | balance scale weighing stone against feather |

(All six case covers were regenerated in style-v2 on 2026-08-22; run
`cover-style-v2-2026-08-22`, recorded per image in each case's
`images.yaml`.)

## Plates: sourcing and treatment

- Source from Wikimedia Commons (or user-owned photography). Run
  `node scripts/add-commons-image.mjs "File:..." <case-slug>` — it verifies
  the license permits reuse, downloads a 1600 px rendition, and emits a
  manifest entry with license/credit/provenance pre-filled. You write `alt`,
  `depicts` (observation language, not interpretation), `plateNumber`, and
  `claimIds`.
- Acceptable licenses: public domain, CC0, CC BY, CC BY-SA (the site credits
  and links the license; BY-SA imposes no obligation on surrounding
  content). Anything else: don't use it.
- The duotone unification lives in CSS (`.plate-img`), keeping originals
  pristine. Never bake the treatment into the file.
- Plates appear in the article via a `{plate:IMG-...}` block on its own
  line, and automatically on the detail pages of any claims listed in the
  plate's `claimIds`.

## Manifest requirements (enforced at build time)

Every image — generated or real — must have `license` and `credit`, or the
build fails. Generated images must also record `prompt`, `styleVersion`, and
`model`. Plates must also record `plateNumber`, `depicts`, and `provenance`.
An image file missing from `public/` fails the build.
