/**
 * Pre-flight citation check — run BEFORE opening a content PR.
 *
 *   node scripts/preflight-citations.mjs [base-ref]   # default: origin/main
 *
 * Runs the arbiter's own mechanical citation verification
 * (scripts/lib/citation-check.mjs) over the content lines your branch
 * adds relative to the base ref, and prints exactly what the panel's
 * seats will be shown — resolved Crossref/arXiv titles beside each
 * identifier — so identifier/title mismatches die at your desk instead
 * of parking the PR.
 *
 * Why this exists: a content PR was parked when three panel seats caught
 * a source record whose title had been written from memory of the
 * paper's subject instead of from the page (erebus PR #113). The
 * mechanical check that caught it only ran inside the arbiter, on the
 * open PR. This is the same check, runnable locally.
 *
 * Reading the output:
 *   - RESOLVES (Crossref: "…") — compare that title, word by word,
 *     against your source record's title. Titles come from the page,
 *     never from memory (docs/CHAT_BRIEFS.md).
 *   - FAILS — either fix the identifier, or make sure the source
 *     record's verificationNote already names the block (bot-wall,
 *     paywall) and the workaround copy actually read (Wayback,
 *     repository PDF). An unexplained FAILS is what a seat will read as
 *     possible fabrication.
 *   - UNCHECKED — tooling limits; the seats judge these on the record's
 *     own verification notes.
 *
 * Exit code: 1 if any citation FAILS (a reminder to explain or fix each
 * one — the arbiter itself never gates on this), else 0.
