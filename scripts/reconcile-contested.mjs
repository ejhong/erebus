/**
 * The reconciliation loop (operator duty #2). A contested standing is
 * honest but static: drafts are written blind to the panel, so without
 * this script a case where the judges dispute the house verdict stays
 * contested forever, with the house never having engaged the objections.
 *
 * For each eligible case this produces a RECONSIDERATION draft — the one
 * deliberately non-blind draft in the pipeline: the model receives every
 * seat's dissent and must answer each one, moving only where the argument
 * compels. The result is an ordinary append-only overlay (role: draft,
 * promptVersion erebus-reconsider-v1); standing re-derives against the
 * existing fresh checks, so no new panel is needed to resolve.
 *
 * Eligibility: the newest checks are current (not stale vs content), the
 * case verdict is disputed by at least two seats, and the latest draft is
 * NOT already a reconsideration — if the house has engaged and the panel
 * still disputes, that is a genuine standoff, displayed indefinitely and
 * reported here rather than re-litigated in a loop.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/reconcile-contested.mjs [--case <dir>] [--dry-run]

  const SYSTEM = `You write a RECONSIDERATION assessment for a case in an evidence-mapping publication. The house draft's case verdict is disputed by independent judges; your task is to engage every dissent on its merits — the way an author answers referees.

Rules:
- Address each dissenting seat's argument explicitly in the synthesis: either concede it and move, or answer it and hold. Silence on a dissent is failure.
- Move ONLY where the argument compels. You are not obliged to converge; you are obliged to engage. If after engagement you hold the original verdict, say precisely why the dissents do not compel.
- Verdicts from this vocabulary only: ${VERDICTS.join(", ")}.
- Distinguish credibility from diagnosticity; repeated reports are not independent; feasibility is not occurrence.
- Synthesis at least 200 words, plain language, citing record ids.
- loadBearing AND weakestLinks are arrays of CLAIM ids only (like XXX-C001) — never evidence ids, never prose sentences. Put the prose reasons in the synthesis. claimAssessments cover every featured claim by id.
