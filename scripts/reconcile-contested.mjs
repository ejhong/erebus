/**
 * The reconciliation loop (operator duty #2). A contested standing is
 * honest but static: drafts are written blind to the panel, so without
 * this script a case where the judges dispute the house verdict stays
 * contested forever, with the house never having engaged the objections.
 *
 * For each eligible case this produces a RECONSIDERATION draft — the one
 * deliberately non-blind draft in the pipeline: the model receives every
 * seat's dissent and must answer each one, moving only where the argument
 * compels. The result is an ordinary append-only overlay (role: draft,
 * promptVersion erebus-reconsider-v1) stamped with `reconciles`: the
 * runIds of the checks whose dissents it engaged. Those checks can never
 * ratify the draft that answered them (src/domain/load.ts ratification) —
 * a reconciled case stays unratified until at least one fresh blind check
 * judges it, which stale-checks.mjs arranges by listing the case for the
 * next content-response re-panel.
 *
 * Eligibility mirrors what makes a standing "contested" in
 * src/domain/load.ts (via scripts/lib/reconcile-core.mjs): the newest
 * checks are current (not stale vs content); the panel disputes either
 * the case verdict (two or more seats) or a load-bearing claim (fewer
 * than a strict majority of judging seats within one step of the draft's
 * verdict — the vasocomputation shape: a unanimous case verdict over a
 * split load-bearing claim); and the latest draft is NOT already a
 * reconsideration — if the house has engaged and the panel still
 * disputes, that is a genuine standoff, displayed indefinitely and
 * reported here rather than re-litigated in a loop.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/reconcile-contested.mjs [--case <dir>] [--dry-run]

  const SYSTEM = `You write a RECONSIDERATION assessment for a case in an evidence-mapping publication. The house draft is disputed by independent judges — on the case verdict, on one or more load-bearing claims, or both; your task is to engage every dissent on its merits — the way an author answers referees.

Rules:
- Address each dissenting seat's argument explicitly in the synthesis: either concede it and move, or answer it and hold. Silence on a dissent is failure.
- If claimDissents is non-empty, engage each split claim BY ID: that claim's reasoning field must answer the seats' arguments (concede and regrade, or hold and say precisely why), and the synthesis must address the split where the claim is load-bearing. A reconsideration that leaves a split claim unaddressed is failure.
- Move ONLY where the argument compels. You are not obliged to converge; you are obliged to engage. If after engagement you hold the original verdict, say precisely why the dissents do not compel.
- Verdicts from this vocabulary only: ${VERDICTS.join(", ")}.
- Distinguish credibility from diagnosticity; repeated reports are not independent; feasibility is not occurrence.
- Synthesis at least 200 words, plain language, citing record ids.
- Sensitivity: in the synthesis, name the single evidence record whose removal would most change the case verdict, and state plainly whether the verdict survives without it. A verdict hanging on one thread must say so.
- loadBearing AND weakestLinks are arrays of CLAIM ids only (like XXX-C001) — never evidence ids, never prose sentences. Put the prose reasons in the synthesis. claimAssessments cover every featured claim by id.
